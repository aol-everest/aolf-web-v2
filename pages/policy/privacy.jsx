                <strong>PURPOSE</strong>
                <p>
                  The Organization is committed to international compliance with
                  data protection laws. This Privacy Policy applies worldwide to
                  the Organization and is based on globally accepted, basic
                  principles of data protection. The Privacy Policy provides one
                  of the necessary framework conditions for cross-border data
                  transmission among the Organization.

                <strong>APPLICATION OF NATIONAL LAWS</strong>
                <p>
                  This Privacy Policy comprises the internationally accepted
                  data privacy principles without replacing the existing
                  national laws. It supplements the national data privacy laws.
                  The relevant national law will take precedence in the event
                  that it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, or it has stricter
                  requirements than this Privacy Policy. The content of this
                  Privacy Policy will be observed in the absence of
                  corresponding national legislation. In the event of conflicts
                  between national legislation and the Privacy Policy, the
                  Organization will work to find a practical solution that meets
                  the purpose of the Privacy Policy.

                    <p>
                      It has been concluded by the European Commission that
                      particular countries outside of the European Economic Area
                      (the “EEA” which consists of all European Union member
                      states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein) require
                      to adequately protect personal data. This can be reviewed
                      under European Commission adequacy decision. Where data is
                      being transferred from the EEA to other countries, we
                      shall comply with legal frameworks that ascertain an
                      equivalent level of protection with European Union law.

                      We shall comply with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
                      Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
